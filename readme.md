# Arena theme for Chrome
Let's make this quick. This is a dark theme for (Are.na)[https://are.na]. It's a WIP.

# Install & Run
1. `git clone git@github.com:jordanegstad/arena-chrome-theme.git`
2. `--watch arena.scss:arena.css`

# Activate Theme
Theme is activated by (Stylish)[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en]. Maybe someday I'll finish and make public?
